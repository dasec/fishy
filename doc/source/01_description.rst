`fishy` is a toolkit for filesystem based data hiding techniques, implemented
in Python. It collects various common exploitation methods, that make use of
existing datastructures on the filesystem layer, for hiding data from
conventional file access methods. This toolkit is intended to introduce people
to the concept of established anti-forensic methods associated with data
hiding.
